                <h2 id=safety>Database Security</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong> Databases</strong> are still the primary solution for storing information. Despite their
                    convenience, the practicality of using databases is accompanied by numerous vulnerabilities, which
                    require additional solutions to ensure database security.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Database security is like a shield protecting the treasures stored within. Initially, databases were
                    designed for collecting and storing data, becoming an extremely convenient tool for easily and
                    quickly obtaining and processing information. However, with the emergence of many security issues
                    related to databases, we must ensure the reliable protection of our information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ensuring database security is of great importance in our modern digital era. It protects our data
                    from unauthorized access. For example, we can consider the threat posed by hackers who may attempt
                    to penetrate a database to access personal user data or a company's financial assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, database security helps protect our information from unexpected system failures that
                    may result from storing large volumes of data. If a database is not adequately protected, all this
                    data may be lost.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 id=danger>Common Threats</h2>
                <p>The main threats faced by databases include:</p>
                <p>
                    <strong id="sql-injection">SQL Injections.</strong> These involve hacking through input fields by
                    integrating malicious code. In practice, there are SQL and NoSQL injection types. SQL injections are
                    characteristic of classic RDBMS, while NoSQL injections affect Big Data platforms. SQL injections
                    are more widespread due to the large number of simplified RDBMS types. NoSQL injections are more
                    complex and targeted, penetrating through specific entry points or components such as Hive or
                    MapReduce. In both cases, when a database is hacked through input injections, attackers gain
                    virtually unlimited opportunities to manipulate data.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/sql-injection-infographic.webp" alt="SQL Injections">

                <p><strong id=hack>Password Hacking</strong> is an attack where an attacker tries to guess a password or
                    use weak passwords to gain access to a database. Password hacking can be automated using password
                    cracking programs (brute force), allowing the attacker to quickly find the correct password and gain
                    access to valuable information.</p>
                <p>
                    Cybercriminal attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and sophisticated: phishing, data
                    substitution, malicious links, codes. Many of them have a disguised and implicit nature, misleading
                    users who are unfamiliar with information security policies and rules. Thus, the risks of hacker
                    threats are unpredictable, capable of leading to numerous security incidents and the most serious
                    consequences for a company if the database protection technology is imperfect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong id="access">Unauthorized Data Access</strong> occurs when an attacker gains access to a
                    database without the owner's or database administrator's permission. This can happen by using weak
                    passwords or security vulnerabilities. As a result, the attacker may gain access to confidential
                    information and use it for their own selfish purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of database security issues in history. One of the most famous is the attack on the
                    <i>Equifax</i> database in 2017 when hackers stole personal information from over 143 million
                    people. This attack occurred due to incredibly weak passwords and vulnerabilities in the security
                    system itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong id="oldversion">Use of Outdated Versions or Inadequate Database Configurations.</strong> The
                    main problem here is morally outdated databases that are operated as they are. Moreover, regular
                    updates and patches are missing. Such an approach to information maintenance makes it easily
                    accessible and accumulates vulnerabilities over time. The main reasons for such an attitude towards
                    databases and the accumulation of problems are the need to disconnect information from the workflow
                    and the duration of the update process.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="methods-to-protect">Methods of Protecting Databases</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the variety of external threats and internal vulnerabilities, protective measures are
                    implemented comprehensively and purposefully. Widely used methods of protecting databases include:
                </p>
                <h3 id="hash">Encryption and Hashing</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Encryption.</strong> Applied to substitute or transform original data or individual
                    information blocks, making it difficult to correctly identify information and assemble it into a
                    whole. Encryption keys are also used as an additional measure without which the stolen information
                    becomes unusable. Encryption can be symmetric or asymmetric, at the database level, or in individual
                    applications. The advantage of encryption is the ability to create protection simultaneously at
                    multiple levels: information, algorithms, functionality. However, this protection has its downside -
                    it complicates database management and increases data processing times due to the need for
                    decryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Password Hashing</strong> is one of the popular authentication methods. Instead of storing
                    the password in plain text in the database, the password is hashed using a special hashing algorithm
                    and stored as a hash value. A hash is a complex algorithm used to create a unique and encoded value
                    for each password.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/hashing.png" alt="Hashing">

                <p>
                    <strong>Use of SSL/TLS Encryption.</strong> During data transmission over the network, data can be
                    intercepted by attackers who can gain access to it. However, when using SSL/TLS encryption, this
                    becomes practically impossible. SSL/TLS encryption uses special certificates and protocols to
                    encrypt data and protect it from unauthorized access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SSL/TLS encryption ensures the security of data transmitted over the Internet and protects against
                    cyber attacks and hackers. This is an important method of data protection used in most web services
                    and applications. Database developers and administrators should ensure that SSL/TLS encryption is
                    used for all data transfers between the client and the server to ensure maximum security and data
                    protection.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/ssl-handshake.png" alt="SSL Handshake">
                <h3 id="authmethod">Authentication Methods in Databases</h3>
                <p>
                    Even with the most advanced information security systems, users still have the possibility of
                    unauthorized access to the database, which can lead to data confidentiality breaches and many other
                    problems.
                </p>
                <strong>Database-Level Access Rights.</strong>
                <p>
                    This authentication method controls access to the database through a database-level access rights
                    system. The programmer or database administrator can manage access levels to the database so that
                    users can only access specific parts of the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Database-level access rights allow restricting access to specific tables or parts of tables, as well
                    as defining rights for reading, writing, and editing data in a particular table. Thus, users can
                    access only the data they need, rather than the entire database.
                </p>
                <strong>Application-Level Access Rights Separation</strong>
                <p>
                    The second authentication method is the separation of access rights at the application level, where
                    access rights are managed from the application rather than directly from the database. This method
                    is sometimes called role-based access control because users must be assigned a specific role to
                    access the application and its functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This authentication method controls access to the application, not the database. This means that
                    users can access the application, but they will not be able to access data in the database if they
                    do not have the appropriate rights. Additionally, this method allows for more thorough control over
                    user access rights management since access rights can be changed according to values stored in the
                    database.
                </p>
                <h3 id="logging">Logging and Monitoring</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Action Logging</strong> is the process of recording all events related to the database in a
                    system log. It may include information about executed queries to the database, data changes, user
                    session times, and other events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider a company that stores confidential customer data in a database. Logging all actions in the
                    database allows tracking all data changes, understanding who and when accessed this data, and
                    tracking any unauthorized actions in the database, such as hacking attempts or changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Logging all actions helps identify vulnerabilities in the database security system and prevent
                    potential security threats.
                </p>
                <p>Consider another method - <strong>User Activity Monitoring.</strong> This is the process of
                    monitoring user actions in the system in real-time to detect any unauthorized actions or unusual
                    user traffic.</p>
                <p>
                    In large organizations such as banks or manufacturing companies, user activity monitoring is
                    conducted to detect any changes in normal work activity, such as unusually active sessions or
                    attempts to access sensitive data at unusual times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User activity monitoring helps identify suspicious activity and notify database administrators of
                    potential security threats.
                </p>

                    <h2 id="examples">Examples of Database Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        Let's consider several examples that can serve as vivid evidence of the effectiveness of
                        security methods in
                        databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1) Access Rights Management in Oracle Database.</strong> Oracle Database is one of the
                        most widely
                        used databases in the world and provides numerous security features, including access rights
                        management. The
                        system allows database administrators to control data access by assigning specific roles and
                        permissions to
                        users and user groups. In practice, this means that users can only access the data necessary for
                        performing
                        their tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>2) SSL Encryption in MongoDB.</strong> MongoDB is a document-oriented database used by
                        many large
                        companies worldwide. One of the security methods used in MongoDB is SSL encryption. SSL
                        encryption protects
                        data transmitted between the client and the application server by encrypting the data before
                        sending it over
                        the network. This helps prevent data interception by malicious actors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3) Google Cloud SQL.</strong> Google Cloud SQL is a managed service providing
                        cloud-based MySQL
                        databases. One of the advantages of Google Cloud SQL is that Google automatically incorporates
                        many security
                        methods into this service, such as data encryption at rest and in transit, access control, and
                        monitoring and
                        access management features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>4) Authentication Methods in Microsoft SQL Server.</strong> Microsoft SQL Server is a
                        widely used
                        relational database with a wide range of security features. In SQL Server, administrators can
                        implement
                        authentication policies to control database access. One authentication method in SQL Server is
                        Windows

                    <p>
                        A company's information resources must be securely protected and regularly monitored to prevent
                        attacks and
                        leaks. There are no universal solutions for all cases; rather, a comprehensive approach and
                        personalized
                        development of database security tailored to specific tasks and information classes are
                        required. This
                        involves engaging experts, security services, and conducting staff training. Any information
                        resource can be
                        hacked, stolen, or copied, so the best defense strategy is to prevent unwanted incidents.
