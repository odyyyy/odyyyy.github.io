                <p>Relational databases have been used for a very long time. They became popular due to successful
                    implementations of relational models in management systems, which proved to be very convenient for
                    working with data. In this article, we will compare three of the most popular relational database
                    management systems (RDBMS): SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.</p>
                <h2 id="rel">Relational Database Management Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    Relational systems implement the relational model for working with data, which defines all stored
                    information as a set of related records and attributes in a table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Databases of this type use structures (tables) to store and work with data. Each column (attribute)
                    contains its type of information. Each record in the database, with a unique key, is passed to a
                    table row, and its attributes are displayed in the table columns.
                </p>

                <h2 id="popular">Popular RDBMS</h2>
                <p>In this article, we will talk about 3 of the most popular RDBMS:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQLite: a very powerful embedded RDBMS.</li>
                    <li>MySQL: the most popular and frequently used RDBMS.</li>
                    <li>PostgreSQL: the most advanced and flexible RDBMS.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="sqlite">SQLite</h2>
                <p>SQLite is an amazing library embedded in applications that use it. Being a file-based database, it
                    provides an excellent set of tools for simpler (compared to server databases) handling of any types
                    of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an application uses SQLite, their connection is made through functional and direct calls to
                    files containing data (such as SQLite databases), rather than through any interface, which increases
                    the speed and performance of operations.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/sql-lite.png" alt="">
                <h3>Supported Data Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>NULL: NULL value.</li>
                    <li>INTEGER: signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes.</li>
                    <li>REAL: floating point number, stored in 8-byte IEEE format.</li>
                    <li>TEXT: text string with UTF-8, UTF-16BE, or UTF-16LE encoding.</li>
                    <li>BLOB: data type stored exactly as received.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For more detailed information, see the <a
                        href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html">documentation</a>.</p>
                <h3>Advantages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Speed.</strong> Thanks to the features of the SQLite architecture, it works fast,
                        especially on reading. Database components are embedded in the application and called in the
                        same process. Therefore, access to them is faster than when interacting between different
                        processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Storage in a Single File.</strong> The database consists of table records, their
                        relationships, indexes, and other components. In SQLite, they are stored in a single file
                        (database file), which is located on the same device as the program. To avoid errors during
                        operation, the file is locked for third-party processes before writing. Previously, this meant
                        that only one process could write data to the database at a time. But in newer versions, this is
                        solved by reconfiguring the DBMS operation mode.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimalism.</strong> SQLite creators follow the principle of "minimal complete set". Out
                        of all SQL features, it includes the most necessary ones. Therefore, SQLite is characterized by
                        a small size, simplicity of solutions, and ease of administration. To enhance basic
                        functionality, you can use third-party software and extensions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small Size.</strong> A fully configured SQLite with all settings takes up less than 400
                        KB. If you use the DBMS without additional components, the size can be reduced to 250 KB. It
                        depends only on the amount of loaded information. Despite its small size, SQLite supports most
                        of the SQL2 standard features and has its own set.</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability.</strong> SQLite is publicly available. There are no legal restrictions on
                        its use, and it is considered a community-owned asset. You can open, view, and modify the source
                        code of the installed software.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limitations in Application.</strong> The absence of a server is both an advantage and a
                        disadvantage. Without a server, the capabilities of the DBMS are fewer. For example, multiple
                        different devices won't be able to access the same database.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Built-in Unicode Support.</strong> Unicode is a popular character encoding
                        standard. It includes virtually all existing characters and letters, so it is considered the
                        most widespread in the world. Without its support, the application won't be able to work
                        correctly with Cyrillic, hieroglyphs, and many other characters. SQLite does not natively
                        support Unicode; it needs to be configured separately. This can cause difficulties with
                        localization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of User Management.</strong> Advanced databases provide users with the ability to
                        manage relationships in tables according to privileges, but SQLite does not have this feature.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>When Not to Use</h3>
                <p>1) Multi-user applications: if you are working on an application where multiple people will
                    simultaneously access the database, it's better to choose a full-featured RDBMS like MySQL.</p>
                <p>2) Applications that write large volumes of data: one of SQLite's limitations is write operations.
                    This DBMS allows only one write operation to be executed at a time.</p>

            <h2 id="mysql">MySQL</h2>
            <p>
                MySQL is the most popular of all major server databases. It is very easy to understand, and there is a
                large amount of information about it available online. Although MySQL does not attempt to fully
                implement SQL standards, it offers a wide range of functionality. Applications communicate with the
                database through a daemon process.
            </p>

                <li>SET: sets.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance: MySQL has good performance and speed due to optimized query execution algorithms. It
                    can handle large volumes of data with minimal delays.</li>
                <li>Security: MySQL includes various security features, including user privilege settings, data
                    encryption, authentication, and auditing, to secure the information stored in databases.</li>
                <li>Power and scalability: MySQL can handle really large amounts of data and is suitable for scalable
                    applications.</li>
                <li>Simplicity: MySQL is easy to install. There are many third-party tools, including visual ones, that
                    make it easier to get started with databases.</li>
                <li>Flexibility: MySQL implements various data types, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, and other
                    features that provide flexibility in data processing. This allows for the creation of complex data
                    schemas. MySQL is compatible with quite a few operating systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>MySQL offers many advantages, making it a popular and widely used choice for working with databases.</p>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance limitations: MySQL may have performance issues when processing large volumes of data or
                    when complex queries need to be processed or when connecting a large number of clients. This can
                    lead to slowdowns or even service failures.</li>
                <li>Limited set of data types: MySQL has a limited set of data types compared to some other DBMSs. For
                    example, support for temporal data and geographic data is limited compared to some other DBMSs.</li>
                <li>MySQL does not comply with the SQL standard: The DBMS does not support some functions and has
                    extensions that are not related to standard SQL. For most projects, this will not be a serious
                    problem, but when migrating to other DBMSs, this issue may arise.</li>
                <li>Complexity of administration: MySQL can be complex to administer, especially for beginners.
                    Configuring and optimizing configuration parameters can be a challenging task requiring deep
                    knowledge and experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When Not to Use</h3>
            <p><i>SQL compatibility:</i> since MySQL does not attempt to fully implement SQL standards, it is not fully
                compatible with SQL. This can cause problems when integrating with other RDBMSs.</p>
            <p><i>Concurrency:</i> although MySQL handles read operations well, concurrent read-write operations can
                cause problems.</p>
            <p>Feature shortcomings: depending on the choice of MySQL engine, some features may be lacking.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="postgresql">PostgreSQL</h2>
            <p>
                PostgreSQL is the most advanced RDBMS, focusing primarily on full compliance with standards and
                extensibility. PostgreSQL, or Postgres, aims to fully comply with ANSI/ISO SQL standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                PostgreSQL differs from other RDBMSs in that it has object-oriented functionality, including full
                support for the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) concept.
            </p>
            <p>Being based on the powerful Postgres technology, PostgreSQL handles concurrent processing of multiple
                tasks excellently. Concurrency support is implemented using MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control),
                which also ensures compatibility with ACID.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Community support: PostgreSQL is supported by an experienced community.</li>
                <li>Support for multiple data types: PostgreSQL supports a wide variety of data types, including
                    standard integer values, floating-point numbers, strings, and boolean values, as well as monetary,
                    geometric, enumerated, binary, and other types. PostgreSQL natively supports bit strings and network
                    addresses, data arrays (including multidimensional arrays), composite types, and other complex
                    structures. It has support for XML, JSON, and NoSQL databases.</li>
                <li>Handling large volumes of data: PostgreSQL has no limitations on the size of the database or the
                    number of records it can contain.</li>
                <li>Support for complex queries: PostgreSQL can handle complex, composite queries, parsing and executing
                    resource-intensive operations involving both reading and writing simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Object-oriented: PostgreSQL is not only a relational but also an object-oriented DBMS.</li>
                <li>Third-party support: Despite its advanced features, PostgreSQL is used in many tools related to
                    RDBMSs.</li>
                <li>Extensibility: PostgreSQL can be programmatically extended through stored procedures.</li>
                <li>ACID compliance: ACID principles ensure data integrity.</li>
                <li>Openness: PostgreSQL is open-source software distributed under a liberal license, allowing
                    developers to view and contribute to its development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Configuration complexities: PostgreSQL has an extensive range of features, which can lead to
                    complexity in configuration settings, potentially causing difficulties for beginners.</li>
                <li>Increased resource consumption: Compared to some other DBMSs, PostgreSQL may consume more resources
                    (including memory and CPU time), especially noticeable when handling large volumes of data and
                    executing complex queries.</li>
                <li>Lack of some features: Compared to certain commercial counterparts, PostgreSQL may lack some
                    functionality.</li>
                <li>Performance: In simple read operations, PostgreSQL may lag behind its competitors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When Not to Use PostgreSQL</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Speed: If all that is needed is fast read operations, PostgreSQL may not be the best choice.</li>
                <li>Simple situations: If you don't require high reliability, ACID support, and so on, using PostgreSQL
                    may be overkill.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="sumup">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the choice between SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL should be determined by the requirements
                of the application. A small application with no need for high performance and scalability makes SQLite
                an attractive option. For large amounts of data and high load, MySQL or PostgreSQL are suitable.
                However, when choosing a DBMS, it is necessary to consider not only the requirements of the application
                but also the available resources and experience in database management.
